# Simple-Weather
Live Demo to fully functioning web app: http://scs.ryerson.ca/~rrsharma/cps630/lab2/index.html.  
Note to use this weather app you must first create a free account on openweathermap so you can be issued an API key.   
• This can be done here: http://openweathermap.org.  
  After receiving an api key, change the var mykey = config.MY_KEY to 
  var mykey = "Paste your api key here".  

This was a class project which had to meet the following criteria:   
• Students are encouraged to build a creative weather information application that is responsive for both various 
  computer sizes and mobile.   
• There must be the option to select between Fahrenheit or Celsius, and users should be able to search for cities around
  the world.    
  
The following Weather Information must be present:   
• Current temp, and weather conditions (cloudy, snow, rain.. etc. ), wind and humidity.   
• Forecast of minimum 5days.

• Use only JavaScript AJAX (no external frameworks such as jquery and others) call to server to get and manipulat information.       
• Update information must be done asynchronously: location change or temperature F to C or C to F.
